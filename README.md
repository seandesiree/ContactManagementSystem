Contactt Management System

This app offers several functions for contact organization, which include:
1. Add a new contact
2. Edit an existing contact
3. Delete a contact
4. Search for a contact
5. Display all contacts
6. Export contacts to a text file

Options 1-3 will prompt you for the contact info you wish to add, edit or delete.
Option 4 will allow you to search for contact info based on name, number or email. 
Option 5 initially will display contacts in the order they are inputed. If you wish to sort them by name, number or email and option will pop up to select that option.
